# Javascript Website Challenge

JM Hansen is a fantasy and sci-fi author. He hired a web developer to design his new website, but unfortunately the developer doesn't know Javascript so the mobile nav menu is completely broken! As a Javascript developer, your mission is to save the day and give this website a mobile-friendly nav menu.
