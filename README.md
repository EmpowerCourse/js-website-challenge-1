# Javascript Website Challenge

JM Hansen is a fantasy and sci-fi author. He hired a web developer to design his new website, but unfortunately the developer doesn't know Javascript so the mobile nav menu is completely broken! As a Javascript developer, your mission is to save the day and give this website a mobile-friendly nav menu.

To complete this mission, you must:

- Create a new javascript file and include it in the HTML.
- Select the navToggle button and assign it to a variable.
- Select the navMenu and assign it to a variable.
- Add an event listener to the navToggle button that toggles the visiblity of the navMenu.
